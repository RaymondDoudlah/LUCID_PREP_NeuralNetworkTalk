# Neural Networks #

Machine learning and artificial intelligence technology is growing at an impressive rate. From robotics and self-driving cars to augmented reality devices and facial recognition software, models that make predictions from data are all around us. Many of these applications implement neural networks, a computational model inspired by the brain.

With recent advancements in computing power and the explosion of big data, we can now implement large models that are capable of learning how to accomplish a task by itself, by only looking at the data you feed it. These deep learning models learn to extract features that the model finds important to help it accomplish the task. 

In this week's session we will be learning about neural networks, and get to play with a convolutional neural network, a model that is used in machine vision, object recognition, and self-driving cars. The topic of neural networks is very broad, so my goal is to give you a brief overview and provide you with enough resources so that you can learn more about specific models that may be applicable to your scientific work. I also want to give you some hands-on practice with running a pre-built model so you can get an intuition for what these models are doing under the hood. 

Session outline:
* Introduce neural networks and their general architecture
